beepMeIn is my first personal project to toy with the Raspberry Pi. The Pi is used as a door opener, hooked up to my physical electrical door relay. While this web interface allows me to put in tracking codes. Usage: So I won't have to be home, waiting for that package. Carrier can just scan package, and safely leave it in my corridor. I also hook this up with Push Notification through PushOver API so that I know exactly when my package arrived.
